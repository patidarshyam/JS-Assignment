Metcalfe’s Law
Robert Metcalfe, the founder of 3Com and one of the creators of Ethernet, is 
credited with creating an equation that defines the value of networks: 
V = N2
In other words, a network’s economic value equals the number of the network’s 
users squared.
Putting Metcalfe’s Law in simpler terms, it means that as you add users, its value 
increases geometrically.
Think of a network of telephones. If you have just one telephone, that single 
telephone has no real economic value. (If you’re the only one with a phone, who 
would you call?) The moment you add a phone, according to Metcalfe’s Law, the 
economic value of the phone network is squared. The economic value of the network 
would go from zero to two squared, or four. Add a third phone, and the economic 
value of the network is now nine. In other words, the economic value of a network 
goes up exponentially, not numerically. Networks Come to the Business World
The classic Industrial-Age business model operated much like an empire. It was 

controlled by a strong central “government” that maintained its strongly centralized 
identity no matter how big it grew.
In the 1950s, a new type of business emerged, one that maintained its coherence 
not by controlling all its parts with a single central office, but instead by using the 
model of a network. This idea was so revolutionary that many criticized it, and the 
U.S. Congress came within eleven votes of declaring it illegal. But it survived its early 
years, and today is responsible for more than 3 percent of American retail sales and is 
thriving around the globe. Some of its more famous brands include Ace Hardware, 
Subway, and, of course, the most famous of them all, McDonald’s.
That radical business model is called a franchise. 
A franchise is a type of business network in which multiple business owners all 
work off the same blueprint. In a very pragmatic sense, you could say they all share 
the same values. 
But franchising was just one step in the process of developing networks in the 
business world. I’ll let John tell you what happened next.
John: Robert’s right. This isn’t just a question of paying a commission 
differently, or shifting the responsibility of marketing to a different party. It’s 
really an entirely different way of looking at business—one that reflects an 
Information-Age economy through networking rather than an Industrial-Age 
economy through centralized mass-advertising. 
After franchising, the next step in the development of networked businesses 
began in the 1960s and really got under way in the 1970s and ’80s. Instead of 
a network of franchised businesses, this model built itself through a network of 
franchised individuals. In a sense, you could call this a “personal franchise.” 
Like the original franchise model, this new type of business also came under 
a lot of criticism; yet, despite its critics, it has survived and thrived. 
That model is called network marketing.
Robert: And, by the way, the truth about franchising is that as a franchise 
owner, you are part of a network—but you don’t own the network; you own 
only your particular business. As a network marketer, on the other hand … 
John: As a network marketer, you not only build the network, but you actually 
own your own network. And, as you put it, Robert, that gives you tremendous 
financial leverage.
In other words, as a network marketer, you get to personally harness the power 
of Metcalfe’s Law.
How? This doesn’t happen simply by affiliating with a network marketing 
company. That’s like having a telephone when you are the only one with the 
telephone. 
To harness the power of Metcalfe’s Law, you
